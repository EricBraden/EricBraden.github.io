            Hi, I have a passion for information technology and robotics. My personal interest include culinary arts, Freemasonry, and exercise.

            I used to work for a company that ran schools in the Middle East during the War on Terror. We provided cover for the Defense Intelligence Agency. That provided an unpleasant and traumatizing introduction to information security and social engineering.
